# Overview

## What are design patterns?

Here are what some authors have said about design patterns:
```
Patterns identify and specify abstractions that are above the level of single classes and instances, or of components. [Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides, 1993]
```
```
Design patterns are recurring solutions to design problems you see over and over. [Alpert, Brown and Woolf, 1998]
```
```
A design pattern describes how objects communicate without becoming entangled in each other's data models and methods. [Cooper, 2000]
```
```
Software design patterns are schematic descriptions of solutions to recurring problems in software design. [Jia, 2003]
```
```
A design pattern is a recipe for solving a certain type of design problem that captures the high-level objects, their interactions, and their behaviors. [Wang, 2003]
```

## A Brief History of Design Patterns and the "Gang of Four"

The concept of patterns (in general) was originally articulated by Christopher Alexander and colleagues in the late 1970s [The Timeless Way of Building, 1979; A Pattern Languageâ€”Towns, Buildings, Construction, 1977] (They had 253 patterns.)

Somewhat later, it was recognized that there are many similarities between software design and architectural design:

Both are creative processes that unfold within a large design space, which comprises all possible designs.
The resulting design must satisfy the customer's needs.
The resulting design must be feasible to engineer.
The designers must satisfy many competing constraints and requirements.
The designers must seek certain intrinsic yet unquantifiable qualities, such as elegance and extensibility.
Pioneering work in this area was done by the so-called "Gang of Four". [See their seminal text on the subject: Design Patterns (Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software), Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, 1995]

Design Patterns became a best-seller, is now regarded as a "ground-breaking" work, and the rest is history: Design patterns have been accepted as a very useful tool by the software development community at large.

Many additional patterns have been identified and described, and more appear all the time.

In a very small way, you are familiar with a number of "mini design patterns". A very small pattern in a programming language is sometimes called an idiom. Can you think of any examples?
