# Overview

## What are design patterns?

Here are what some authors have said about design patterns:
<ul><li>
  
Patterns identify and specify abstractions that are above the level of single classes and instances, or of components. [Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides, 1993]

</li><li>
Design patterns are recurring solutions to design problems you see over and over. [Alpert, Brown and Woolf, 1998]
  
</li><li>
  
A design pattern describes how objects communicate without becoming entangled in each other's data models and methods. [Cooper, 2000]
  
</li><li>
  
Software design patterns are schematic descriptions of solutions to recurring problems in software design. [Jia, 2003]
  
</li><li>
  
A design pattern is a recipe for solving a certain type of design problem that captures the high-level objects, their interactions, and their behaviors. [Wang, 2003]
  
</li>
</ul>

## A Brief History of Design Patterns and the "Gang of Four"

The concept of patterns (in general) was originally articulated by Christopher Alexander and colleagues in the late 1970s [The Timeless Way of Building, 1979; A Pattern Languageâ€”Towns, Buildings, Construction, 1977] (They had 253 patterns.)


Somewhat later, it was recognized that there are many similarities between software design and architectural design:

<ul><li>
Both are creative processes that unfold within a large design space, which comprises all possible designs.
  
</li><li>
The resulting design must satisfy the customer's needs.
  
</li><li>
The resulting design must be feasible to engineer.
  
</li><li>
The designers must satisfy many competing constraints and requirements.
  
</li><li>
The designers must seek certain intrinsic yet unquantifiable qualities, such as elegance and extensibility.
  
</li></ul>

Pioneering work in this area was done by the so-called "Gang of Four".(Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides).


Design Patterns became a best-seller, is now regarded as a "ground-breaking" work, and the rest is history: Design patterns have been accepted as a very useful tool by the software development community at large.


Many additional patterns have been identified and described, and more appear all the time.
